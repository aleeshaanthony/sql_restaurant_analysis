Taste of World Cafe - SQL Analysis

Project Overview

At the start of the year, Taste of World Cafe debuted a new menu. The goal of this project is to analyze customer data and evaluate how well the new menu items are performing. This involves identifying which items are popular, which are underperforming, and understanding the preferences of top customers.

Objectives

Explore the menu_items table to understand whatâ€™s on the new menu.
Analyze the order_details table to examine the data collected from customer orders.
Combine insights from both tables to assess customer reactions and identify trends.
